This primer scheme was manually modified to include the primers and strands
using data avaialble through the ONT websit and artic protocols.
The original primer scheme provided by epi2me-wf/artic was missing the primers,
pool, and strand positions which are required by artic, and the primer-scheme repository
recommended by artic does not include the ONT scheme.

You can find the original scheme bed file in the the `depeciated/` directory.
